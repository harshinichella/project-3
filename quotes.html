    <div class="quotes">
        <h3>BLISS</h3>   
        <p>Because of Bliss, beings hold on to life. They toil seeking Bliss. In friendship, they find Bliss. They make sacrifice to find bliss. It is Bliss alone that cannot be renounced.</p> 
        <p>"Bliss is reality." - Vedanta</p>
        <h3>ANGER</h3>
        <p>When man becomes a prey to anger he loses all refinement. He turns into a lunatic for the time being. Spoilt ambrosia becomes poison. A sound mind is ambrosia. But when it is tainted with anger it turns into poison. An angry mind vomits vile thoughts. It transmutes the whole system into venom. The food consumed while in anger becomes injurious to health. An angryman's judgement is clouded.</p> 
        <p>"Obstructed desire turns into anger. It is the worst enemy of man." - Vedanta</p>
        <h3>TIME</h3>
        <p>There is no compensation for the loss of time. What is wasted is gone once for all. Time is the interval between two incidents. It is without beginning and end. Man gets his quota in it. Foolish is he who does not know the value of time. He squanders it. Wise is he who accounts for it. By making the best use of time man builds his career. He who knows the value of time has known the secret of life.</p> 
        <p>"I am the mighty world-destroying Time now engaged in wiping out the world." - Bhagavad Gita</p>
        <h3>THE SINNER</h3>
        <p>It is meaningless to condemn a man as an irredeemable sinner. In several rebirths he pays dearly for his delinquency and then reforms himself. Eternal damnation is not the plan of Providence. After experimenting with life in evil ways man get enlightened into the right path. In the process of evolution a sinner also has his own way of coming up. He only delays his onward march.</p>
        <p>"Every saint had a PAST. Every sinner has a FUTURE." - Tayumanavar</p>
        <h3>TRUTHFULNESS</h3>
        <p>The ordinary man thinks that he gains by telling lies. Whereas the profit of truthfulness is incalculable. Clean conscience is the ultimate reward. When the utterance comes into conflict with the occurrence it is a lie. That person is given to truthfulness who relates the happenings exactly as they are. The unpleasant incidents, the failures and the iniquities are all frankly admitted or confessed by the truthful man. Integrity elevates man to divine.</p> 
        <p>"Do not deviate from truthfulness. Truthfulness builds man's character." - Vedanta</p>
        <h3>CALMENESS</h3>
        <p>Disturbed state of mind dissipates away the energy. Calmness on the other hand gathers it up. Calmness under all circumstances characterizes the seasoned man. A gentle gust causes commotion in twigs, reeds, and creepers. But the most violent gale does not disturb the trunk of a tall tree. Likewise the trained up mind maintains its calmness in trials and tribulations.</p> 
        <p>"There is no ruffle when the pitcher is filled to the brim. So is the knowing mind." - Proverb</p>
        <h3>COMPANY</h3>
        <p>Gregarious creature that man is, he is in need of company. So let him choose the congenial to his growth. Solitude is sought as a training ground. It is not a lifelong aim. Then man lives in company. Birds of the same feather flock together, is the proverb. A man's make up is known by the sort of company that he seeks. It is the group life that aids the growth of man.</p> 
        <p>"Seek the company of the good and the wise. It protects you and promotes your spiritual career." - Ramakrishna</p>
        <h3>FEAR OF OLD AGE</h3>
        <p>Stealthily old age overtakes all beings; and they reconcile themselves with it. But man alone fears it most. Barring them who meet with premature death, all have to face old age. That is the period to reflect on the evanescence of earthly life and to mature in wisdom. Instead man abhors old age and tries to arrest it. Vain is his attempt.</p>
        <p>"Changes in life are to be accepted as calmly as the changes in season." - Mahabharata</p>
        <h3>PEACE</h3>
        <p>All beings love peace because it is their original state. It is in peace alone that social progress is possible. Peace is the criterion for mutual understanding and cordial relationships. Elements in nature are usually at peace. Occasionally they are in turmoil, pressed hard for readjustment. Beings resort to strife because of compulsion. Peace-makers among men are the salt of the earth.</p>
        <p>"Peace follows enlightenment. When man establishes peace at heart no external force can disturb it." - Vedanta</p>
